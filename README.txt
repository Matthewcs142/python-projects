    pong.py
  Description:
    This project is the result of a freecodecamp video tutorial published on Youtube for making games with python3. This tutorial's objective was to teach basics of game development by recreating the classic game, pong. Two important notes about this project: the code is not object-oriented, and the game is written using the turtle module. Additionally, the lines of code referring to sound are written for local audio files on a machine using a windows operating system.

    facebook_combined.txt
  Description:
    This was the final project for a data science math course put together by the National Research University School of Higher Economics based in Moscow, Russia and offered through the Coursera website. This project required the use of the NetworkX python module to model and analyze social network data (contained in facebook_combined.txt) taken from the SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project) dataset. The end goal of the exercise was to use NetworkX to visualize the data contained in facebook_combined.txt, generate a random graph based on the characteristics of the facebook_combined.txt data, and calculated average clustering coefficients.

  Files committed:
   my_first_gui.py
  Description:
   This is the first gui I have ever created. It is a small, very basic, gui made with the tkinter libarary as part of a video based coding course posted on YouTube by FreeCodeCamp at this url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA
   Since the code contained in this file is the for the very first gui I have ever written, and the first time I have ever used the tkinter library, it is not the cleanest code in the world; however, I did use comments to try to make it a bit cleaner than it otherwise would have been.
