  Files committed:
    pong.py
  Description:
    This project is the result of a freecodecamp video tutorial published on Youtube for making games with python3, which may be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc. This tutorial's objective was to teach basics of game development by recreating the classic game, pong. Two important notes about this project: the code is not object-oriented, and the game is written using the turtle module. Additionally, the lines of code referring to sound are written for local audio files on a machine using a windows operating system.

    final_project_solution.ipynb
    facebook_combined.txt
  Description:
    This was the final project for a data science math course put together by the National Research University School of Higher Economics based in Moscow, Russia and offered through the Coursera website, which may be viewed here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs. This project required the use of the NetworkX python module to model and analyze social network data (contained in facebook_combined.txt) taken from the SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project) dataset. The end goal of the exercise was to use NetworkX to visualize the data contained in facebook_combined.txt, generate a random graph based on the characteristics of the facebook_combined.txt data, and calculated average clustering coefficients.

  Files committed:
   my_first_gui.py
  Description:
   This is the first gui I have ever created. It is a small, very basic, gui made with the tkinter libarary as part of a video based coding course posted on YouTube by FreeCodeCamp at this url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA
   Since the code contained in this file is the for the very first gui I have ever written, and the first time I have ever used the tkinter library, it is not the cleanest code in the world; however, I did use comments to try to make it a bit cleaner than it otherwise would have been.

Sixth commit:

  Files committed:
    first_calculator.py
  Description:
    This is a basic calculator created in python using the tkinter library. The calculator is capable of performing addition, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. Created as part of tkinter course posted on YouTube by FreeCodeCamp at this url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA 

Seventh commit:
  Date of commit:

  Files committed:
    mbox-short.txt
    mbox-short.py
    mbox-short2.py
    mbox-short3.py
    mbox-short4.py
  Description:
    The mbox files are a python project that was part of the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody, Python Data Structures course offered through the Coursera platform. The class can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python
    For this project, students were provided a data set containing email data and they were asked to open the text file containing the data (mbox-short.txt) and then write python functions that would manipulate and transform that data to slice it up, clean it, and isolate specific sections.

Eigth commit:

   tkinter_images_icons.py
  Description:
   This is a simple gui demonstrating the use of images and icons. 

Ninth commit:
  Date of commit:
   10/31/20
  Files committed:
   coded_correspondence_my_solutions.ipynb
  Description:
   This notebook contains my solutions for a Codecademy Project from Codecademy's Learn Python3 course. This project requried use of python functions to iterate through multiple different lists to solve Cesear and Vigenère Ciphers. My solution for the Vigenère cipher is the most complext function in the entire project. That function iterates through multiple lists while keeping track of the index values in each list to solve the cipher. The hardest part of that solution was getting python to iterate through the key phrase properly.

Tenth commit:

  goblin_dictionaries.ipynb
 Description:
  This is a Codecademy project from Codecademy's Learn Python3 course. This project required the use of dictionaries to work with email data.
